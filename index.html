<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white;">  This app serves primarily to help track where naloxone (Narcan®) is being distributed in Chautauqua County. If you haven’t already done so, please let me know that you’re using this app so I can add your name to the drop down list. (Email link is below.)<br>
<br>
<br>
To enter an instance of naloxone distribution, tap “Next” (below). This will open a map. You can make the map full screen by tapping ⛶. Zoom into the approximate location where you gave out the naloxone. Drag and drop the red pin onto the approximate location. The pin doesn’t have to be super-precise, just close to the actual location. 
 <br>
 <br>
You can also search for an address by using the address field below the map.
 <br>
 <br>
Tap “Next” again. You’ll then be prompted to answer 6 questions:
 <br>
 <br>
</p>
<ul style="font-size:16px">
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:16px">Source of naloxone: Who provided the naloxone you're distributing?  If the agency isn't in the dropdown list, please indicate the source in the "Notes" box, below.</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
<ul style="font-size:16px">
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:16px">Given by: Select your name from the dropdown box.</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
 <li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:16px">Date given</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:16px">Number of naloxone kits given: This is the number of boxes – each containing 2 doses – that you gave out.</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:16px">Was training provided?: Some people already know how to use it and don’t need/want training. (You can use the videos on the first page (in English and Spanish) as a help for training.)</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
 <li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:16px">Approximate age: You don’t need to ask the person. Just make your best guess.</span></li>
 </ul> 
 <br>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white;">You can add an optional “Note” to provide further information if you’d like.
 <br>
 <br>
If it is not possible to make a separate entry for each person who received naloxone (for example, at a busy event), you can make one entry for multiple kits given. If you have any sense of the demographics of the recipients, add a note to that entry such as: “About half of the recipients were between 20-29, the rest over 50.”
 <br>
  <br>
 When finished with the entry, tap “Submit.” This will return you to the app's homepage.
