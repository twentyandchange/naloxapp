<p style="font-size: 14px; color: white;">  If you haven’t already done so, please let me know that you’re using this app so I can add your name to the drop down list. (Email link is below.)<br>
<br>
<br>
To enter an instance of naloxone distribution, tap “Next.” This will open a map. Using two fingers, zoom into the approximate location where you gave out the naloxone. Drag and drop the red pin onto the approximate location. The pin doesn’t have to be super-precise, just close to the actual location. 
 <br>
 <br>
You can also search for an address by using the address field below the map.
 <br>
 <br>
Tap “Next” again. You’ll then be prompted to answer 5 questions:
 <br>
 <br>
</p>
<ul style="font-size:14px">
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:14px">Given by: Select your name from the dropdown box.</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
 <li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:14px">Date given</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:14px">Number of naloxone kits given: This is the number of boxes – each containing 2 doses – that you gave out.</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
<li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:14px">Was training provided?: Some people already know how to use it and don’t need/want training.</span></li>
 <br>
 <br>
 <li style="color:white" ><span style="color:white; font-size:14px">Approximate age: You don’t need to ask the person. Just make your best guess.</span></li>
 </ul> 
 <br>
 <br>
<p style="font-size: 14px; color: white;">You can add an optional “Note” to provide further information if you’d like.
 <br>
 <br>
If it is not possible to make a separate entry for each person who received naloxone (for example, at a busy event), you can make one entry for multiple kits given. If you have any sense of the demographics of the recipients, add a note to that entry such as: “About half of the recipients were between 20-29, the rest spread over the other ages. About 75% were male.”
 <br>
  <br>
 When finished with the entry, tap “Submit.” This will return you to the homepage.
